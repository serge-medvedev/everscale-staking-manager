# FreeTON Staking Manager

## HOWTO

- Refer to [config.js.example](config.js.example) to create the config file
- Make sure you have the client private key and the server public key, generated by _setup.sh_ script during validator engine initialization
- Build the image and run a container with [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml):
    ```yaml
    version: "2.3"
    services:
      freeton-staking-manager:
        image: sergemedvedev/freeton-staking-manager
        volumes:
          - ./config.js:/usr/src/app/config.js:ro
          - ./certs:/usr/src/app/certs:ro
          - ./db:/data/freeton-staking-manager
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        environment:
          DEBUG: "api,lib:*"
        restart: always
    ```
    ```console
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```
