## Have it Up & Running

- Refer to [config.js.example](config.js.example) to create the `./config.js` file
- Make sure you have the client private key and the server public keys, generated by _setup.sh_ script during validator engine initialization, stored in `./certs` directory (must contain `client`, `server.pub` and `liteserver.pub` files).
- Build the image and run a container with `./docker-compose.yml` like this:
    ```yaml
    version: "2.3"
    services:
      freeton-staking-manager:
        image: sergemedvedev/freeton-staking-manager
        volumes:
          - type: bind
            source: ./config.js
            target: /usr/src/app/config.js
            read_only: true
          - type: bind
            source: ./certs
            target: /usr/src/app/certs
            read_only: true
          - type: volume
            source: freeton-staking-manager-data
            target: /data/freeton-staking-manager
        ports:
          - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
        environment:
          DEBUG: "app,api,lib:*"
        restart: always

    volumes:
      freeton-staking-manager-data:
    ```
    ```console
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

## API Reference

### POST /stake/:action
Tries to send/recover/resize a stake

> __:action__ "send", "recover" or "resize"

NOTE: only "send" (without "force") is usable in "depool" funding mode

Example:
```console
$ curl -XPOST localhost:3000/stake/recover
```

Pass _force_ query parameter to send a stake even if it's "already submitted":
```console
$ curl -XPOST localhost:3000/stake/send?force=yes
```

Pass _value_ query parameter to set the default stake size:

```console
$ curl -XPOST localhost:3000/stake/resize?value=20000
```
---

### POST /elections/:action
Allows to skip upcoming elections (no idea why one would need it)

> __:action__ "skip" or "participate"

Example:
```console
$ curl -XPOST localhost:3000/elections/skip
```
---

### GET /elections/history
Returns info (keys, stake, etc.) about elections the node participated in

Example:
```console
$ curl -s localhost:3000/elections/history | jq '.'
```
---

### POST /validation/resume
Returns the node back to validation after it's re-sync'ed from scratch

Example:
```console
$ curl -XPOST localhost:3000/validation/resume
```
---

### GET /stats/:representation
Shows validator stats

> __:representation__ "json" or "influxdb"

Pass _interval_ query parameter (in seconds) to change the time frame for blocks signatures counting (default: 60s)

Example:
```console
$ curl localhost:3000/stats/json?interval=3600
```

---

## TODO

- Add basic authentication
- Add multiple nodes management
